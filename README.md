# FG-PFRPG-Upgrade-NPC-Actions
This extension replaces NPC spell actions with those from [PFRPG - Spellbook](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?58962-PFRPG-Spellbook).
Spell actions replacement occurs automatically when the NPC is added to the combat tracker.

To update a spell with the latest improvements from [PFRPG - Spellbook](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?58962-PFRPG-Spellbook), right-click the spell and click "reparse".
The spell will be deleted and re-added with the latest information.

This extension allows easier creation of NPCs, as spells can be entered on Spells tab with no fields filled in. Details will be populated when NPC is added to CT.

For users of my [Malady Tracker extension](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?60290-PFRPG-Disease-Tracker-Extension), the NPC name will also be checked against the maladies and a link will be added to the Notes tab for any poisons it has.

Some additional NPC actions will also be created when eligible NPCs are added to the combat tracker.

* Ancestral Enmity
* Arcane Strike
* Bleed (requires manual entry of quantity)

* Critical Focus
* Deadly Aim
* Defended Movement
* Defensive Combat Training 
* Furious Focus
* Mobility
